Functional and exploratory testing

Functional testing is done by using manual and automated test techniques.
Functional Tests covered - Create and delete a booking

Exploratory tests covered - field validations, layouts

First name and last name values are overlapped on to the next fields when the text is long.
Checkin and checkout dates can be from the past.
Checkout date can be earlier than checkin date.

Field validations:
First name - No validation for length and data types
Surname - No validatio for length and data types
Price - Accepts only integers and decimals
Deposit paid - Drop down list with two values allowed - True/false
Checkin & checkout dates - only date types allowed. But when we enter an 8 digit number - 11111111, it converts it into a date from 1970s
